## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use textContent for the alert message on empty input field as it needs two different error message for two different condition.

### Continued development

I will continue to improving my skill on build a page with javascript.

### Useful resources

- [HTML DOM Element textContent](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_node_textcontent.asp) - This page explains the differences between innerHTML, innerText and textContent. A useful resoure to let us know when to use one of them as the page has the example of each of them.
